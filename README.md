# Linear Algebraic Utility Tool 
Introduction to Computer Science Spring 2024 Minor Project
## Overview
This C program is designed to perform various operations on matrices and polynomials. It offers functionality for matrix operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, finding determinant, adjoint, transpose, inverse, and determining various properties of matrices such as symmetry, skew symmetry, triangularity, singularity, idempotence, nilpotence, orthogonality, and involutiveness. Additionally, it supports polynomial operations such as addition, multiplication, estimation of real roots using Newton's method, differentiation, and integration. Furthermore, it provides a method to solve linear equations using either row-echelon or Gaussian elimination combined with back substitution.
